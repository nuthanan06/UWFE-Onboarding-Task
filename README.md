# UWFE Onboarding Task
As a part of the UW Formula Electric Firmware Team, we were tasked to control an LED with an STM32 on a Nucleo board using a potentiometer, lighting it above 1.5V. 

Project template provided by STM32 IDE. [Linked is the main code controlling the onboarding task](Core/Src/main.c).
